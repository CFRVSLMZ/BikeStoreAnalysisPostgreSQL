# Bike Store Analysis with PostgreSQL
A comprehensive SQL analytics project for the Bike Stores database. It features 30 complex queries utilizing CTEs and Window Functions to extract key business metrics like YoY growth, staff ranking, and customer repeat rates.

In this project, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the **BikeStores database** to uncover valuable insights into **sales performance, inventory management, customer behavior**, and **staff productivity**.

🔹 **Store & Sales Performance:**
We examined total and monthly sales by store, pinpointed top-performing locations, and assessed year-over-year growth. The findings revealed that a small number of stores generate the majority of revenue, with sales reaching their peak during specific months.

🔹 **Product & Inventory Insights:**
Through detailed SQL queries, we identified the best-selling products, categories with the highest inventory turnover, and items that were never sold. We also highlighted brands offering the most premium products and detected those underperforming compared to their category averages.

🔹 **Customer Behavior Analysis:**
Our analysis showed that many customers returned for repeat purchases, with some consistently reordering the same products. By tracking the average time between first and second purchases, we gained deeper insight into customer loyalty and engagement trends.

🔹 **Staff Performance & Operations:**
We evaluated staff performance based on total sales and order counts, identifying top contributors. Additionally, differences in average discount rates among employees provided clues about varying sales approaches and strategies.

**In summary**, this project offered a data-driven overview of the company’s performance across multiple dimensions—enabling actionable insights to enhance **sales strategy, customer retention**, and **inventory optimization**.
